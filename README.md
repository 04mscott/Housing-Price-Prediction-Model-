# Housing-Price-Prediction-Model-

This project analyzes housing cost data found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/discussion/207885) using the Pandas Python library, using data science techniques for data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.
+ Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed a real estate dataset, extracting key date features and handling missing values.
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.stats to examine relationships between house prices and features such as square footage, location, and number of bedrooms.
+ Machine Learning Models: Implemented and evaluated regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict housing prices.
## Key Findings: 
+ Identified important predictors of house prices and assessed model performance using r2_score and mean_absolute_error.
+ This project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, visualize trends, and apply machine learning for predictive analytics.
