# Housing-Price-Prediction-Model-

In this project I used multiple forms of regression from the SciKit-Learn library within a Jupyter environment to predict housing prices based on the Kaggle dataset found [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/discussion/207885))

## Regression
I used the following types of regression to predict housing prices
+ Linear Regression
+ Lasso Regression
+ Ridge Regression
+ Random Forest Regression
+ Gradient Boosting Regressor
+ Stacking Regressor
+ Voting Regreesor

Overall, I found that the Random Forest Regression resulted in the most accurate predictions, with the following test results
+ Mean Absolute Error: 68147
+ Mean Squared Error: 13253078421
+ R2 Score: 0.8856831032516632
